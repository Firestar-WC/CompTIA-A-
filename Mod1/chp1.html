                      To replace a screen, pop off the old one and put the new one on. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Remember</span>, the <strong>wireless antenna</strong> is often attached to it.

                      If you aren't recieving power even when the battery is plugged in, and <strong>the battery works just fine</strong>, then the DC jack might need replacing. Just unscrew it and rescrew it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Touchpads are hard to replace, but are hardly ever needed. They are very durable, and usually the other parts of the laptop give out before it does.

                    <li>
                      If the plastic frame of the computer is broken, then it is generally safe to assume that many other internal parts are broken as well. Another sign to replace it!

                    <li>
                      When replacing spakers, check the sound cards first. Speakers are hardly ever the issue.

                    <li>
                      For replacing system boards (motherboards) or CPUs, remove the old one and replac with the new one, making sure that all connections to it are re-established.

                    <li>
                      Make sure the integrated peripherals are in the same spot for system boards!

                    <li>
                      One thing to remember: system boards are meant to be reliable and don't usually break. If it crashes somehow, it might be better to get a new laptop rather than remove all the parts and replace it.
